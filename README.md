# Overview
This is a Kotlin program that I have written to demonstrate what I have learned
while using a tutorial called Beginners Book. It gave hands on demonstrations 
as you go through the information. This was very helpful to understand and 
process the information learned.

I have shown how to use a data class to display the customer information and
format it to be readable.

# Development Environment

I worked in Visual Studio Code as my IDE and downloaded Kotlin language to my
computer. I added the extensions: Code Runner, Extension Pack for Java, 
Gradle Language Support, json.

These helped me to get Kotlin to run in VS code.
